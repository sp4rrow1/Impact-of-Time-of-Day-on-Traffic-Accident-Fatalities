This repository contains the analysis of traffic accident fatalities in relation to the time of day (day vs night). Using data from the ISTAT dataset, the project explores the causal relationship between time of day and traffic fatality rates in Italy. The methods employed include advanced propensity score techniques such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) while controlling for selection bias.
